# Inspecting the Privacy in a Privacy-Preserving Public Transport Ticketing System

This project models the privacy-preserving pubic transport ticketing system as presented by Milutinovic et al. in the  paper _[Privacy-Preserving Public Transport Ticketing System](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20810-7_9)_.

This project is realized in the IDP 3 (http://dtai.cs.kuleuven.be/krr/software/idp).

The IDP input model representing the privacy-preserving public transport ticketing system can be found [here](https://github.com/decroik/inspect-temporal-privacy/blob/master/Ticketing-ppts.idp).

The results can be found in the following IDP [output model](https://github.com/decroik/inspect-temporal-privacy/blob/master/Ticketing-ppts-output.txt).
